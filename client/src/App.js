As an app, I am designed to provide a specific function or set of functions to smartphone or computer users. My purpose can vary greatly depending on the type of app I am, but I might be designed to help users organize their schedule, connect with friends and family, play games, track fitness goals, or perform any number of tasks. I'm created with programming languages like Java, Swift, or Python and can be downloaded from app stores like Google Play or the Apple App Store.
